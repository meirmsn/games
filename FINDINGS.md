# Findings

What Claude noticed while working on this repo and didn't fix, kept so the owner can watch what
comes back. A finding is not a task.

| ID  | Severity | What was noticed | Seen |
| --- | -------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| F-1 | low | No test that bumping `VERSION` in `sw.js` clears the old cache. It matters only when the precache list (`SHELL`) changes, and `sw.js` and the README say when to bump it. | 2026-11-06 · meirmsn/games#3 review |
| F-2 | low | Scripts and styles are served cache-first and refresh in the background, so for one load after an update a returning visitor can run an older script with the newer page. Harmless today; it would matter if a page and its script had to change together (`sw.js`). | 2026-11-06 · meirmsn/games#3 review |
| F-3 | low | Googly Faces keeps its own colours in `googly-faces/game.css` (sky, dots, buttons), with light and dark values, instead of deriving them from the site's theme tokens in `assets/base.css`, so a later token change won't reach the game. | 2026-11-06 · meirmsn/games#6 review |
| F-4 | low | After a newer merge goes live first, `scripts/deploy.sh` writes `version` as `<sha> (live: <sha>, a newer merge)`, not the bare short SHA the spec names; the deploy comment shows that text in its "New version" line. | 2026-11-08 · meirmsn/games#9 review |
| F-5 | low | The `all-cloudflare-deploys AC-9` test checks `SITE_URL` and `PREVIOUS_SHA` are on the deploy step's "---" env line, but not that they appear nowhere else in `ci.yml`. | 2026-11-08 · meirmsn/games#9 review |
| F-6 | low | Orbit's hidden-assist test catches a probe just outside the band at 3 misses (5%), but never probes the 10% and 15% widths at 4 and 5 misses directly; the levels test pins only the 15% maximum and the limit's steps. | 2026-11-09 · meirmsn/games#13 review; 2026-11-09 · meirmsn/games#13 review, the booster round |
